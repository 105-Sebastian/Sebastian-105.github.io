# Using my Website
  You have to press `run` This website took a lot of time to make so I would apprecite if you could not copy off me and plagiarize this code.
## Forking
If you do decide to fork this website that you might want to follow these steps first: <br>
1). you have to remove all of these <br>
```
window.location.replace("url") 
```
Unless it is directly linking something then delete it. <br>
2). If you find those go through every HTML page and remove 
``` 
 <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
	<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CCS6F21XDE">
	</script>
	<script>
		window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());
      gtag('config', 'G-CCS6F21XDE');
	</script>
```
